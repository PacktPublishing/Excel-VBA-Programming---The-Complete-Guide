Download Course Materials
This lecture includes a .zip file with the completed course files. These represent the final versions of the Excel workbooks that were created during the filming of this course. 

Please note that there may be slight differences between the content of the workbooks and the content of the videos. These differences are negligible; you'll be able to understand the concepts if you proceed through the course in a linear fashion.

The workbooks are organized by course section. The name of the workbook will usually be identical to the lesson name. Sometimes, content across multiple lessons will be packaged into a single workbook.

It is strongly recommended that you use the workbooks strictly as a point of reference. The best strategy for your technical development is to:

open Excel alongside the course videos
create a new workbook (if needed) for each course video
copy the code that I write out in the video
execute and test the code in your Excel application
experiment with the code to see what else it can do
